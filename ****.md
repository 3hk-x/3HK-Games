## 🚀 INSTALL
We rely on _three primary_ sources to get ******* directly added to your account.

First, download the tool called [*****Tools](https://www.steamtools.net/download.html#) from their official website.

The next steps will guide you through how to connect your account, claim free games, and automate the entire process using the tool.<br>
🎥 Watch the video below in youtube for a step-by-step tutorial.

## 👁️ GUID
1. Go to **** and copy the name of the game you want.
2. Open [****DB](https://steamdb.info/) and paste the game name into the search bar.
3. Copy the game's App **_ID_**.
4. Head to [Lua Generator](https://cysaw.org/) and paste the **_App ID_** to generate the game’s Lua file.
5. After downloading and opening the generated Lua file, drag all files except __readme.txt into the main application ****Tools.
6. Restart **** from within ****Tools, as shown in the tutorial video.

## 🧩 File Format: .st
⚠️ Note: Some games may be in .st format instead of .lua, which might prevent them from appearing in your ***** library right away.

To fix this:

1. Drag the .st files as-is into the program.
2. Download and run [ST2Lua.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K6iMQxEga7OeV8cnV20Z_jlhoN824aUg/view?usp=sharing) — the app will open and close instantly.
3. Open your **** account, and you should now see the game in your library.
4. ✅ That’s it — enjoy your game!

## 🗑️ DELETE GAMES
 To remove a game you previously added,<br> simply download **CreamInstaller**.
After launching it, select the game from the list and remove it with one click.<br>
